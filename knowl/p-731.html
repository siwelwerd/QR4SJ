<div class="para">A week before the law was slated to go into effect, it was struck down by a federal judge, in a case brought forth by a 15-year-old transgender girl and her family. In speaking about the effects of gender-affirming care, the girlâ€™s mother said, "We have a confident, happy daughter now, who is free to be herself and she is thriving" [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ACLU.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.6.1">[5.6.1]</a>. Judge Eli Richardson, in his decision on the case, repeatedly argued that "parents have a fundamental right to direct the medical care of their children" <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/court-documents.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.6.2">[5.6.2]</a>. This argument highlights the role of parents in seeking basic medical care for transgender youth, and it also uses a commonplace term that was never found in the bill itself: "medical care." In contrast, the downstricken bill referred to medical "procedure(s)," a term chosen to connote experimental, invasive, and potentially harmful treatments.</div>
