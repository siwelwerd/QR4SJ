<div class="para">A common claim in the news media, and a common feeling among trans and nonbinary folks, is that 2023 is by far the worst recent year for anti-trans legislation. How do we explore if 2023 was the year of anti-trans legislation? This question is vague - what does an answer to this question mean? How do we use this information in our advocacy? In order to conduct research, we need to drill down into more specific questions that can be answered empirically. This is an important story that needs to be documented to mitigate and eventually prevent future cases of hate. We are trying to understand broader patterns to better understand where our advocacy work may make a difference.</div>
