<div class="para">In the above activity we had bar graphs that allows us to compare the numerical data of a particular variable (total number of passed bills from 2018 to 2023) with the total number of introduced bills within this same time period or the total number of bills that crossed over again during the same time period. Using these graphs we can explore a relationship between the proportions of bills which are crossed over or passed within each year as well as the trend over time as to what proportions are crossed over or passed. These bar graphs are sometimes referred to as <em class="emphasis">multigraphs</em>.</div>
