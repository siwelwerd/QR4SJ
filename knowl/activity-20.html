<li><div class="para">After running the code, some tables and graphs will appear directly in the code. Return to the .Rmd tab and scroll through the code until you find the following table. How many times does the word “employee” appear in the bill? Hint: look at the “n” column. What is the relative frequency of the word “education”? Hint: look at the “relf” column.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Continue to scroll through the graphs. Talk with a partner about what looks nice in each graph, and what you would want to change. Which graph is your favorite? Why?</div></li>
