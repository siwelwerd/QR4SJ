<div class="para">In this course, most of the material in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/mcdevittClassNotesCryptologic2012.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.4.17">[3.4.17]</a> (which is also provided to students as a supplementary resource) is discussed, with the possible exception of probability, which is often left out due to time constraints. A sample of the discussion of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and modular exponentiation is provided in a Subsection <a href="extensions-and-alterations.html#the-diffie-hellman-key-exchange" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.2.1: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange">Subsection 3.2.1</a>. These notes lead into the material on the square-and-multiply algorithm, Euler’s Theorem, and eventually RSA encryption described in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/mcdevittClassNotesCryptologic2012.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.4.17">[3.4.17]</a>. Sometimes, the extended Euclidean algorithm is also introduced after describing the importance of finding multiplicative inverses when cryptanalyzing the affine cipher, though students without much prior mathematical experience tend to find this material confusing and somewhat intimidating.</div>
